Android App for Comic Book Tracking


## Project Background
Keeping up to date with comic books can a frustrating task. Because most issues are released monthly, or sometimes even longer, it is easy to forget what the last issue you read was. For myself and other friends I have talked to, we have long wanted a method that simplifies the process of keeping track of what we are reading, instead of manually keeping a list on paper or in a text file. I have used apps in the past that help me keep track of which television shows I am watching. They helped me list which episode to watch next after a long gap. For this reason, I set out to create a similar management application for comic books. 

It is important to note that this application does not allow users to read any comic books. It only helps users to keep track of what they are reading. It is also not an app to help maintain a person’s physical comic book collection. At time I wrote this app (late 2016), I did not find a readily available API that I could source the comic book information from so I made a small database of a handful of comic books for demo purposes, which I no longer have access to.

## Login Instructions

When the app first opens, a login/registration screen is displayed. Users can enter a username and password and press “Login” if the account exists, or press “Register” if it needs to be created. A username that I have setup and used as an example for demonstrating is “user@name.com” with the password “pass123”.
